### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn‚Äôt listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in `PLANNING.md`.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For agents this looks like:
    - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic 
    - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent 
    - `prompts.py` - System prompts
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use python_dotenv and load_env()** for environment variables.

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a ‚ÄúDiscovered During Work‚Äù section.

  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### üìö Documentation & Explainability

### üéØ 12-Factor Agent Methodology
Following the 12-Factor Agents principles for production-ready AI systems:

#### Context Engineering & Ownership
- **Own Your Context Window**: Strategically manage all information provided to AI agents
- **Own Your Prompts**: Maintain full control and ownership of prompt engineering
- **Compact Errors into Context Window**: Efficiently capture and represent error states within context
- **Unify Execution State and Business State**: Integrate computational processes with core business logic

#### Agent Architecture & Design
- **Small, Focused Agents**: Break complex tasks into narrow, specialized agent components
- **Make Agent a Stateless Reducer**: Design agents as predictable input-output transformation systems
- **Natural Language to Tool Calls**: Translate human language into structured tool/function invocations
- **Tools are Structured Outputs**: Treat tools as predictable, structured data interfaces

#### Control Flow & Integration
- **Own Your Control Flow**: Maintain explicit programmatic control over agent behavior
- **Launch/Pause/Resume with Simple APIs**: Create flexible, interruptible agent workflows
- **Contact Humans with Tool Calls**: Use tool invocations as communication mechanisms
- **Trigger from Anywhere**: Enable agent activation through diverse entry points

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** ‚Äì only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task from `TASK.md`.
- **Always maintain contractor independence** - no employee-like control or management
- **Prioritize premium service quality** over cost-cutting measures
- **Enforce 3-strike system** for quality violations consistently
- **Follow 12-Factor principles** for all agent development and context management
